## My process

The first step was to become familiar with the CSS and HTML content that was provided by Udemy and the Javascript course, 
the next thing was to attend to each of the instructions of the different presentations on each of the functions that had to be applied in this project 
coming from the version of javascript ES6, having already made the application of these updates, we proceeded to refactor some functions 
that were created always aiming to improve and clean the code trying to avoid repeating code (DRY code).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript ES6
- DOM manipulation

### What I learned

In this learning process I have been able to increase my skills on the DOM-manipulation in addition to being able to become more 
familiar with the ES6 javascript updates.

## Acknowledgments

I am very happy to continue advancing in this learning process, I know that for each person in this world of programming it is different, 
some of us take more time than others, but the important thing is that if something that we are passionate about is something that we must follow and if 
it is something that you have fun it is not work

## Got feedback for me?
